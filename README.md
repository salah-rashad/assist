# Assist

A tool designed to simplify the management of Dart and Flutter projects. It automates repetitive
tasks, improves developer experience, and ensures projects remain up-to-date.

This package is ideal for developers looking to save time, reduce errors, and improve their overall
development workflow.

The tool is particularly useful for developers who want to streamline their workflows when working
with Dart packages on `pub.dev`.
